# cero-rs
#### A serialization library for GNURadio's ZeroMQ blocks.
>The name Cero is a _very_ loose pun/play on words. The word for zero in spanish is 'cero', and if you squint/mispronounce it hard enough, the _ser_-ialization joke might just make sense



#### License
Cero, being a (de)serialization library for GNURadio, draws much of its deserialization logic from [GNURadio itself](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio). As such, cero is licensed under the GNU GPLv3. Please see the license file in the root of the repo for more information.
